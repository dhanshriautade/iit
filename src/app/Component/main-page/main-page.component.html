    <div>Currently, most computer systems use user IDs and passwords as the login patterns to authenticate users.
      However, manypeoplesharetheirloginpatternswithcoworkersandrequest these coworkers to assist co-tasks, thereby
      making the pattern as one of the weakest points of computer security. Insider attackers, the valid users of a
      system who attack the system internally, are hard to detect since most intrusion detection systems and ﬁrewalls
      identifyandisolatemaliciousbehaviorslaunchedfromtheoutside world of the system only. In addition, some studies
      claimed that analyzing system calls (SCs) generated by commands can identify these commands, with which to
      accurately detect attacks, and attackpatternsarethefeaturesofanattack.Therefore,inthispaper, a security system,
      named the Internal Intrusion Detection and Protection System (IIDPS), is proposed to detect insider attacks at SC
      level by using data mining and forensic techniques. The IIDPS
      createsusers’personalproﬁlestokeeptrackofusers’usagehabits
      astheirforensicfeaturesanddetermineswhetheravalidloginuser is the account holder or not by comparing his/her
      current computer usage behaviors with the patterns collected in the account holder’s personal proﬁle. The
      experimental results demonstrate that the IIDPS’s user identiﬁcation accuracy is 94.29%, whereas the response
      time is less than 0.45 s, implying that it can prevent a protected system from insider attacks effectively and
      efﬁciently. Index Terms—Data mining, insider attack, intrusion detection and protection, system call (SC), users’
